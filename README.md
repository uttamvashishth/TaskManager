# TaskManager

In this Task Manager we can add our task list and mark that task as completed or incomplete. We can write the new task in the input box and click on the "Add" button then the new task will be added to the list.
We can click on the task name to mark it as completed or incomplete task. We will add a close icon to delete the particular task from the Task Manager.
In this JavaScript Project we are using Local Storage  that will manages the tasks and store it on your web browser, So that if you close and restart the browser then also it will display your saved Tasks.
You can access this Task Manager live over the following link: https://uttamvashishth.github.io/TaskManager/
